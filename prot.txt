realtime monitoring of treshold tuning

2 extract frames with ffmpeg 
ffmpeg -i project_video.mp4 project_video_frames/frame-%04d.jpg
goal to set the tunes the thresholds correctly and build a robust filter

3. Depending on the 


L: 123-141
S: 162-255
X: 37-169
y: 68-180
Mag: 85-168
h: 20-25


observations
low light with shadow (frame 1045)
S-Thresholded: (162, 255) not good
L-Thresholded: (122, 255) very good
Gradient Magnitude Thresholded (68, 255) OK (some
y -direction (68, 145) OK
x-Direction (48, 138) good
H Channel thresholded (20, 30) 

light without shadow bright road(frame 1032)
S-Thresholded: (162, 255) very good
L-Thresholded: (122, 141) not good - too much pixel get through the filter
Gradient Magnitude Thresholded (68, 255) (not good) left lane disappear
y -direction (68, 145) not good - left, right lanes disappear
x-Direction (48, 138) not good - left, right lanes disappear
H Channel thresholded (20, 25) good for the left line but right lane clearly missing

light with shadow (frame 1039)
S-Thresholded: (162, 255) not good
L-Thresholded: (122, 255) very good
Gradient Magnitude Thresholded (68, 168) (very good)
y -direction (68, 145) OK
x-Direction (48, 138) good
H Channel thresholded (20, 30) 

change from low light to more light without shadow (frame 0994)
S-Thresholded: (162, 255) very good 
L-Thresholded: (122, 255) not good mixed region with more pixel and less pixel
Gradient Magnitude Thresh not good (68, 168) (very good) lanes disappearing 
y -direction (68, 145) not good lanes disappearing in region with more light
x-Direction (48, 138) good
H Channel thresholded (20, 30) Ok


light without shadow dark road(frame 1170)
S-Thresholded: (162, 255) very good
